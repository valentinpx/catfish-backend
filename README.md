# Catfish Backend
This project is a backend server for the Catfish project.
It receives organizes and stores the data sent by the Catfish in MQTT to a MySQL database and provides an API to access it.

# Usage
## Setup
Install docker and docker-compose.
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project based on the `.env.example` file.

## Run
Run `docker-compose up` to start the server.

# Development
The MQTT broker, database and python server run in docker containers that can be configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## MQTT Broker
The MQTT broker configuration is stored in the `moquitto/config` folder.

## Database
The server interracts with a MySQL database thanks to the [MySQL Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en) library. The file `src/db.py` contains the DB class that handles the connection and queries.
The tables are created the class constructor at the first run of the server.

## API
The server exposes an API to access the data stored in the database thanks to the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) library.
The API routes are defined in the `src/api.py` file.
